# Multiple Disease Prediction System

The goal of this project is to accurately identify and predict the likelihood of a patient having one or more specific diseases based on various factors such as their medical history, symptoms, family history and lifestyle. The system would use data analysis and machine learning algorithms to evaluate the inputted data and provide a list of probable diagnoses, with corresponding probabilities assigned to each potential disease.
